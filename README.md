# heart-sound-classification-lstm
- Designed and trained a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to classify heart disorders based on sound analysis.
- Sourced a dataset of 835 heart sound samples using both the iStethoscope Pro iPhone app (general public) and the DigiScope digital stethoscope (clinical trials).
- Achieved high model performance: 99% training accuracy, 94% validation accuracy, and 95% test accuracy.
- Model successfully distinguishes between heart murmurs, normal heart sounds, and artifacts.
